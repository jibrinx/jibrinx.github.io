## About Me
<img src="assets/img/wavy.gif">
<p align="justify"> Hi! I’m Jibrin. I love building projects and following my curiosity. I am always curious about how our world operates, and whether we can find a theory that will explain it all... My research applies Quantitative methods including machine learning, advanced statistical and bioinformatics techniques to investigate key questions in epidemiology to address emerging public health challenges.

## Education
- **2022** - MS in Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics from the Institute of Digital Technologies at Loughborough University London. 
- **2019** - BS (Hons) in Computer Science from University of Jos, Nigeria.

## Work Experience
<p align="justify"> I am a Research fellow at the West African Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases (WAC-EID) under the D43 TRAIN grant where I will contribute to research efforts in strengthening health systems and improving infectious disease control strategies in Nigeria (Particularly Lassa Fever) My goal is build real time integrated surveillance systems that address the impact of climate change on the emergence and spread of Zoonotic Pathogens.
<br> <br>
Previously, I served as a senior Machine Learning Engineer at <a href="https://greysoft.ng"  target="_blank">Greysoft Technologies</a>, Nigeria, leading a team of three ML engineers. Together, we tackled local challenges in education, agriculture, and the food supply chain, which led to the creation of impactful startups like  <a href="https://agrobays.com"  target="_blank">AgroBays Agrofoods </a>,  <a href="https://app.5minutes.ng"  target="_blank">5Minutes </a>, and the BRIT App (Bookkeeping, Receipting, Invoice, and Tax).<br>
I have also contributed to a number of research initiatives, including projects funded by New Venture Fund through Data.org and Microsoft, the Embassy of France in Nigeria's Solidarity Fund for Innovative Projects, and the NIH-supported K43 project (K43TW011416) at JUTH.
<br>  
Thanks a lot to the support of my advisors and my sponsors, I am able to conduct research and continue learning/building things that interest me.
</p>

## Research Interests

I am interested in Bayesian modelling, Uncertainty Quantification, Computational Epidemiology, and Explainable Forecasting of infectious diseases. I am currently learning and exploring research papers on Simulation-based inference for Epidemiological dynamics. Feel free to recommend me some good papers in this area <br>
