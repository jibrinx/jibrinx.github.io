  - title: Mathematical Modelling of Anti-Malaria Drug resistance.
    authors: I focused on developing a comprehensive model for anti-malaria drug resistance. This involved a thorough examination of parasite population dynamics, drug treatment impacts, host immune responses, and various epidemiological factors. My findings contributed to the formulation of effective strategies for combating drug-resistant malaria.
