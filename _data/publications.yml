  - title: "Collaborative project with WeAreTheNews startup"
    authors: As the unit team lead for the collaborative project between Loughborough university London and <a href="https://www.wearethenews.com"> WeAreTheNews startup</a>, I worked on 1. The integration of blockchain in news to revolutionise transparency, ownership, and monetization. 2. Enhancing news article credibility by ensuring the immutability of news articles. 3. Smart contracts to automate fair revenue distribution 4. Proposed the WATN coin to enable micropayments for precise content consumption. 5. Developed measures to ensure GDPR compliance.

  - title: Mathematical Modelling of Anti-Malaria Drug resistance.
    authors: I focused on developing a comprehensive model for anti-malaria drug resistance. This involved a thorough examination of parasite population dynamics, drug treatment impacts, host immune responses, and various epidemiological factors. My findings contributed to the formulation of effective strategies for combating drug-resistant malaria.
